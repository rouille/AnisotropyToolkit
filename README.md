The *Coverage & Anisotropy Toolkit* is a set of C++/ROOT (https://root.cern.ch) programs that we developed for the Pierre Auger Collaboration. This software allows the users to smooth sky maps with any beam window; compute the statistical significance of an excess in any direction of the sky; estimate the angular power spectrum of the events; compute their angular correlation function; search for a dipolar modulation and perform harmonic analysis to the right ascension distribution of the events. The Coverage & Anisotropy Toolkit can also be used to simulate events according to the geometrical exposure of the SD. Besides, the simulated events can be generated in order to follow any anisotropic patterns on the sky and/or any temporal modulation.

Executables (`example_*.exe`) illustrating what can be done are available. These files enclose a synopsis and are thoroughly documented.
